# pyDuino libraries

This respository is designed to help aid with development by porting some of the arduino libraries into python to be used in pyDuino.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

You will need a fully installed Arduino based board installed with appropriate drivers installed and ready to communicate through a COM port. More information can be found on this at;

```
